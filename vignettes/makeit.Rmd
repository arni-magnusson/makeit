# Overview

The [makeit](https://cran.r-project.org/package=makeit) package provides a
simple [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))-like utility to run
R scripts if needed, based on the last modified time. It comes with no package
dependencies, organizational overhead, or structural requirements.

The general idea is to run a workflow without repeating tasks that are already
completed. A workflow consists of one or more R scripts, where each script
generates output files.

The `makeit` package offers the core functionality of GNU Make. As such, it
provides the building block to construct a pipeline of arbitrary complexity.
Similar to writing a Makefile, one can organize `make()` declarations in a
script called `_make.R` or the like. It is straightforward to transition a
simple workflow between a GNU Makefile and `makeit` declarations, with only
minor syntax modifications.

Rather than writing a dedicated `_make.R` file for governing a workflow,
specific `make()` calls can also be used inside any functions or scripts to
selectively run computational tasks as needed.

# Tutorials

The following tutorials come with the package and can be copied from
`library/makeit/examples` to a working directory, or downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/arni-magnusson/makeit/tree/main/inst/examples).

## analysis

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="examples/analysis")
```

This example consists of a script `analysis.R` that uses `input.dat` to produce
`output.dat`.

**Before**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(dir(), sep="\n")
```

**Run**

```{r}
make("analysis.R", "input.dat", "output.dat")
```

Try running again:

```{r}
make("analysis.R", "input.dat", "output.dat")
```

Note how a `make()` call has the general form: script *x* uses *y* to produce
*z*.

**After**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(dir(), sep="\n")
```

## sequential

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="examples/sequential")
```

This example consists of three scripts, where one runs after the other.

The plot script produces files inside a `plots` folder and the table script
produces files inside a `tables` folder.

**Before**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(dir()[dir() != "_make.R"], sep="\n")
```

**Run**

```{r}
make("01_model.R", "data.dat", "results.dat")
make("02_plots.R", "results.dat", c("plots/A.png", "plots/B.png"))
make("03_tables.R", "results.dat", c("tables/A.csv", "tables/B.csv"))
```

For convenience, a `_make.R` file is provided, containing these `make()` calls.

**After**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
files <- dir(recursive=TRUE)
files <- files[files != "_make.R"]
files <- c(grep("/", files, value=TRUE),
           grep("/", files, value=TRUE, invert=TRUE))
cat(files, sep="\n")
```

## four_minutes

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="examples/four_minutes")
```

Similar to the 'sequential' example above, but based on the
[four-minutes](https://github.com/wlandau/targets-four-minutes) tutorial that
comes with `targets` package.

**Before**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(dir()[dir() != "_make.R"], sep="\n")
```

**Run**

```{r}
make("get_data.R", "data_raw.csv", "data/data.csv")
make("fit_model.R", "data/data.csv", "output/coefs.dat")
make("plot_model.R", c("data/data.csv", "output/coefs.dat"), "output/plot.pdf")
```

For convenience, a `_make.R` file is provided, containing these `make()` calls.

**After**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
files <- dir(recursive=TRUE)
files <- files[files != "_make.R"]
files <- c(grep("/", files, value=TRUE),
           grep("/", files, value=TRUE, invert=TRUE))
cat(files, sep="\n")
```

## dag_wikipedia

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="examples/dag_wikipedia")
```

<img

alt="diagram" width="120">

DAG example based on the diagram provided in the Wikipedia article on [directed
acyclic
graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph#Mathematical_properties).

Each script produces a corresponding output file: `a.R` produces `out/a.dat`,
`b.R` produces `out/b.dat`, etc.

**Before**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(dir()[dir() != "_make.R"], sep="\n")
```

**Run**

```{r}
make("a.R", prereq=NULL, target="out/a.dat")
make("b.R", prereq="out/a.dat", target="out/b.dat")
make("c.R", prereq="out/a.dat", target="out/c.dat")
make("d.R", prereq=c("out/b.dat", "out/c.dat"), target="out/d.dat")
make("e.R", prereq="out/d.dat", target="out/e.dat")
```

For convenience, a `_make.R` file is provided, containing these `make()` calls.

**After**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
files <- dir(recursive=TRUE)
files <- files[files != "_make.R"]
files <- c(grep("/", files, value=TRUE),
           grep("/", files, value=TRUE, invert=TRUE))
cat(files, sep="\n")
```

## dag_targets

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="examples/dag_targets")
```

<img
src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arni-magnusson/makeit/main/inst/examples/dag_targets.png"
alt="diagram" width="400">

DAG example based on the example from the `targets` [user
manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/targets.html#dependencies).

The `second_target` depends on `first_target` and `outer_function`, which in
turn depends on `inner_function` and `global_object`.

**Before**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
cat(dir()[dir() != "_make.R"], sep="\n")
```

**Run**

```{r}
make("first_target.R", NULL, "output/first_target.dat")
make("global_object.R", NULL, "output/global_object.dat")
make("second_target.R",
     prereq=c("output/first_target.dat", "output/global_object.dat",
              "inner_function.R", "outer_function.R"),
     target="output/second_target.dat")
```

For convenience, a `_make.R` file is provided, containing these `make()` calls.

**After**

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
files <- dir(recursive=TRUE)
files <- files[files != "_make.R"]
files <- c(grep("/", files, value=TRUE),
           grep("/", files, value=TRUE, invert=TRUE))
cat(files, sep="\n")
```

# Discussion

## Use cases

The `make()` function is a tool that can be applied to many types of workflows,
consisting of one or many R scripts. It is especially useful when the complete
workflow takes many minutes or hours to run. Changing one part of the analysis
will then update the related plots and tables, without rerunning every part of
the analysis.

## Your project

Most analyses resemble the `sequential` example above, dividing the workflow
into steps that run one after another. As an introductory example, the
`sequential` workflow consists of only three steps: model, plots, and tables.

In practice, it is usually practical to divide a workflow into more steps than
that, the first step being data preparation, such as importing, filtering,
aggregating, and converting the data to the format that the model expects.

If the model is non-trivial, it can be practical to have an output.R step
righter after model.R, extracting the results from the model-specific format to
a more general format that is easy to browse, tabulate, and plot. This way, the
model.R script can be very short, making it easy to see and understand the
modelling approach and configuration. Separating the fundamental modelling step
from the manual labor of data preparation and plotting can make an analysis more
open and reproducible - for others to browse and reuse.

The paradigm of using small dedicated scripts with clear input and output files
(read and write function calls near the beginning and end of each script) is
usually a better workflow design than managing a large monolithic script where
the user navigates between sections to run selected blocks of code.

## Comparison with other packages

The `four_minutes` and `dag_targets` examples above provide an interesting
comparison between the `makeit` package and the `targets` package, for example.

**makeit**

The `makeit` package is script-based, where each step passes the results to the
next step as output files. The user organizes their workflow by writing scripts
that produce files.

The `makeit` package has no package dependencies, takes a very short time to
learn, and can be used to run any existing workflows, as long as they are based
on scripts with input and output files. The scripts may include functions, but
that is not a requirement.

The package consists of a single function that does one thing: run an R script
if underlying files have changed, otherwise do nothing.

**TAF**

The `TAF` package contains a similar `make()` function as an expert tool, but it
is not part of the core functionality of the package. The overall aim of `TAF`
is to support and strengthen reproducibility in science, as well as
reviewability.

The `TAF` package provides a structured modular design that divides a workflow
into four main stages: `data.R`, `model.R`, `output.R`, and `report.R`. The
initial data are declared in a `DATA.bib` file and an optional `SOFTWARE.bib`
file can be used to declare specific versions of R packages and other software.

The package consists of many useful tools to support reproducible workflows for
scientific analyses.

**targets**

The `targets` package is function-based, where each step passes the results to
the next step as objects. The user organizes their workflow by writing functions
that produce objects. It is the successor of the older `drake` package.

The `targets` package relies on many underlying packages, takes some time to
learn, and some work may be required to realign existing workflows into
functions. The functions may produce files, but that is not a requirement.

The package consists of many useful tools to support workflow design and
management.

**Comparison**

Package   | Paradigm  | State   | Package dependencies | Time to learn | Run existing workflow  | Features
--------- | --------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | --------
`makeit`  | Scripts   | Files   | None                 | Very short    | Must be file-based     | One
`TAF`     | Scripts   | Files   | None                 | Some          | Must be file-based     | Many
`targets` | Functions | Objects | Many                 | Some          | Must be function-based | Many
